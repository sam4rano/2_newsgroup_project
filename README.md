# 2_newsgroup_project

Complete NLP pipeline for classifying the 20 Newsgroups dataset! ðŸš€  

It covers:  
- **Data Loading & Exploration:** Fetching and visualizing class distributions.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Grouping and merging categories to simplify classification tasks.  
- **Text Preprocessing:** Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and cleaning.  
- **Vectorization:** Using both **CountVectorizer** and **TF-IDF** to convert text to numerical features.  
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Training **Multinomial Naive Bayes**, **SVM**, and **Random Forest** classifiers with accuracy and detailed classification reports.  
- **Visualization:** Plotting confusion matrices to analyze model performance.  

More work that can be done  
1. Help you optimize the pipeline or add more models (like **Logistic Regression** or **BERT**).  
2. Refine the text preprocessing (maybe adding **n-grams** or **custom stopwords**).  
3. Tune hyperparameters (like adjusting SVMâ€™s **C** value or RFâ€™s **n_estimators**).  
4. Analyze the results further (maybe with ROC curves or deeper error analysis).  
5. Package everything neatly into a **reusable script or notebook**.
